# ContactManager
This was a Contact Manager Web Application with basic CRUD operations created by Arjun Pherwani, Nathaniel Lyra, Pedro Castano, Devin Vanzant and Javier Martinez.
We made this for the class Processes of Object Oriented Software Design at the University of Central Florida.
The theme and title of this project was Summit Contacts. We hosted this on GoDaddy.
I personally worked on project managment as well as front end design and programming.
